# reference_parser_ssai
Fork of reference_parser with additional parameters for existing parsers and function for returning original string with refs.
A dart package that parses strings for bible references. You can parse single references or
multiple references from a string in a variety of formats and also identify a text to
its potential match in the bible.

Really 99% of what you need to know will be found in the 
[Parsing References](#parsing-references) and [Identifying References](#identifying-references)
headers. But if you have more complicated needs this package can handle those!

# Usage

to include the default exports of reference parser add this to your imports:
```dart
import package:reference_parser_ssai/reference_parser.dart`
```

## Parsing References
use the `parseReference` function to retrieve a single reference:

```dart
var ref = parseReference("I like Mat 2:4-10 and John 3:1");
```
This will return a reference object describing 'Matthew 2:4-10'.

use the `parseAllReference` to retrieve all references within a string.

```dart
var refs = parseAllReferences(' Gen 5:7 is fun to read.');
```
**Note**: The word 'is' will NOT be parsed as the book of Isaiah.

```dart
var refs = parseReferencesAndReplaceString('Gen 5:7 is fun to read.');
```
This will return "Genesis 5:7 is fun to read."

## Identifying References
import the identification library with:

`import 'package:reference_parser_ssai/identification.dart';`

then identify references like this:
```dart
identifyReference("Come to me all ye").then((possibilities) => {
      print(possibilities[0]), // The most likely match would be at index 0
    });
```
The `identifyReference` method uses [biblehub.com](https://biblehub.com).
It will return a PassageQuery object that contains a Reference object along with
a preview of the verse and the original query.

## Objects and References

### Reference
Reference objects are the broadest kind of reference.
You can directly construct one by following this format:

```dart
var ref = Reference(book, [startChp, startVer, endChp, endVer]);
```
(for ease of use the `Reference` class has multiple named
constructorsr. Look [here](#constructing-references) and at the API reference.)

Their most important fields are these:
```dart
ref.reference // The string representation (osisReference, shortReference, and abbr also available)
ref.startVerseNumber
ref.endVerseNumber
ref.startChapterNumber
ref.endChapterNumber
ref.referenceType // VERSE, CHAPTER, VERSE_RANGE, CHAPTER_RANGE
```
Based on what is passed in, the constructor will figure out
certain fields. For example, if you were to construct `Reference('James')`
the last chapter and verse numbers in James will be initialized accordingly.

There are many other fields that may prove useful such as 
ones that subdivid the reference, look [here](#other-fun stuff)

-------

### Verses

`Reference` objects have a `startVerse` and `endVerse` field
that return objects of the Verse type.
```dart
var firstVerse = ref.startVerse;
var randomVerse = Verse(book, chapter, verse);
```

You can also construct `Reference`s that 'act' like
verses by using the named constructor
```dart
var ref = Reference.verse(book, chapter, verse);
```

------

### Chapters
```dart
ref = parseReference("James 5 is a chapter");
```
The `ref` object now holds a `Reference` to "James 5". Despite this, startVerseNumber and endVerseNumber are initialized to the first and last verses in James 5. 
```dart
ref.startVerseNumber // 1
ref.endVerseNumber // 20
ref.referenceType // ReferenceType.CHAPTER
```

The Reference object also has start/end chapter fields
```dart
var ref = parseReference('James 5-10 is cool');
ref.startChapterNumber // 5
ref.endChapterNumber // 10
```

Just like verses you can create chapter objects:

```dart
var chp = Chapter(book, chapter);
```
------

### Books
```dart
var ref = parseReference("Ecclesiastes is hard to spell");
ref.startChapterNumber // 1
ref.endChapterNumber // 12
ref.ReferenceType // ReferenceType.BOOK
```
Books don't have their own class, they're the equivalent of
a `Reference` object.

## Constructing References

### Verses
```dart
var ref = Reference("Mat", 2, 4);
var ref = Reference.verse("Mat", 2, 4);
var verse = Verse("Matt", 2, 4);
```
Note that the `verse` object has different fields than a
`Reference` object. Check the API.

### Verse Ranges
```dart
ref = Reference("Mat", 2, 4, null, 10);
ref = Reference.verseRange("Mat", 2, 4, 10);
```
These are equivalents that create a reference to 'Matthew 2:4-10'.

The same constructors and classes apply for chapters.

### Invalid References
All references have an `isValid` field that says whether this reference
is within the bible.

```dart
var ref = Reference("McDonald", 2, 4, 10);
print(ref.isValid) // false, as far as I know at least.
```
**Notice that the other fields are still initialized!!** So if needed, make
sure to check that a reference is valid before using it.
```dart
ref.reference // "McDonald 2:4-10"
ref.book // "McDonald"
ref.startVerseNumber // 4
ref.osisBook // null, and so will be other formats.
```

The same logic applies to chapters and verse numbers.
```dart
ref = Reference("Jude", 2, 10);
ref.isValid // false (Jude only has one chapter)
```
## Other fun stuff
I made this library bloat so it can do a lot haha.
```dart
ref.verses // returns a list of verse objects within this reference. There's Also one for chapters.
ref.chapters // each chapter
ref.osisReference // the osis representation (there's also short, and abbr)
```
## SSAI Fork
This fork includes a few modifications to the original package.
### Exclusion of common words
Common words will now be excluded by default. "is", "am", "song", and "songs" were being flagged as references for "Isaiah", "Songs of Solomon", "Amos", and "Songs of Solomon" respectively.
### Replace string with parsed references
```dart
var ref = parseReference("I like Mat 2:4-10 and John 3:1");
```
This will return a reference object describing 'Matthew 2:4-10'.

use the `parseAllReference` to retrieve all references within a string.

```dart
var refs = parseAllReferences(' Gen 5:7 is fun to read.');
```
**Note**: The word 'is' will NOT be parsed as the book of Isaiah.

```dart
var refs = parseReferencesAndReplaceString('Gen 5:7 is fun to read.');
```
This will return "Genesis 5:7 is fun to read."

Pass `excludeList: ['strings','to','ignore']` as second argument to either function to exclude custom strings.
### Place parser
```dart
parsePlace('I visited Jerusalem and Damascus and Allammelech and Mississippi.'); //Returns ['Jerusalem','Damascus','Allammelech']
```
